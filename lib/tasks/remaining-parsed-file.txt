Annex III - Civil Nuclear CooperationA. General1. Iran and E3/EU+3 decided to co-operate, among others, including through IAEAtechnical cooperation, where appropriate, and without prejudice to the existing bilateralagreements, in different areas of civil nuclear co-operation to be developed within theframework of this JCPOA, as detailed in this Annex. In this context, the JointCommission will also support assistance to Iran, including through IAEA technicalcooperation projects, as appropriate.2. All civil nuclear cooperation projects under this JCPOA will be mutually determined bythe participating states and will be consistent with the JCPOA and the national laws andregulations of the participating parties.

3. The civil nuclear and scientific cooperation projects envisioned between Iran and theE3/EU+3 as part of this JCPOA may be undertaken in a variety of formats, with a varietyof potential participants. A given project undertaken by the E3/EU+3 will not necessarilyinclude participation by all E3/EU+3 parties:

 3. bilateral or multilateral cooperation arrangements with Iran. Such arrangements wouldbe mutually determined by the participating states.

3. projects under the auspices of the IAEA, either through IAEA technical co-operationprojects including through Project and Supply Agreements.

3. through International Science and Technology Centres.

1.2.2.Specifically, E3/EU+3 parties will undertake, to develop nuclear co-operation with Iran, inparticular within the following areas:B.

Iran will take the leadership role as the owner and as the project manager, and haveresponsibility for overall implementation of the Arak modernisation project. AWorking Group composed of E3/EU+3 participants will be established to supportand facilitate the redesigning and rebuilding of the reactor. An internationalpartnership composed of Iran and the Working Group would implement the Arakmodernisation project, with E3/EU+3 participants assuming responsibilities asdescribed in Annex I. The Working Group could be enlarged to include other

 countries by consensus of the participants of the Working Group andIran. E3/EU+3 participants and Iran will conclude an official document expressingtheir strong commitments to the Arak modernisation project in advance ofImplementation Day which would provide an assured path forward to modernise thereactor and would define the responsibilities assumed by the E3/EU+3 participants,especially in the key areas such as redesign, design review and certification, reactorcore manufacturing, fuel design, fabrication and supply, safety and security, spentfuel treatment or disposition, as well as concerning the supply of materials,equipment, instrumentation and control systems, and subsequently contracts wouldbe concluded. The participants of the Working Group will provide assistanceneeded by Iran for redesigning and rebuilding the reactor, consistent with theirrespective national laws, in such a manner as to enable the safe and timelyconstruction and commissioning of the modernised reactor.5. Iran and the Working Group will cooperate to develop the final design of themodernised reactor and the design of the subsidiary laboratories to be carried outby Iran, and review conformity with international safety standards, such that thereactor can be licensed by the relevant Iranian regulatory authority forcommissioning and operation.5. Iran will continue to assume the primary responsibility for financing themodernisation project. Additional funding arrangements for the project, including forIAEA projects supporting the Arak modernisation project, will be determined basedon the official document and contracts to be subsequently concluded.6.
