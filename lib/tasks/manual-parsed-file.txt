[SUBTITLE] Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action

[DATE] Vienna, 14 July 2015

** < > PREFACE

**** < > The E3/EU+3 (China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States, with the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy) and the Islamic Republic of Iran welcome this historic Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which will ensure that Iran’s nuclear programme will be exclusively peaceful, and mark a fundamental shift in their approach to this issue. They anticipate that full implementation of this JCPOA will positively contribute to regional and international peace and security. Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons.

**** < > Iran envisions that this JCPOA will allow it to move forward with an exclusively peaceful, indigenous nuclear programme, in line with scientific and economic considerations, in accordance with the JCPOA, and with a view to building confidence and encouraging international cooperation. In this context, the initial mutually determined limitations described in this JCPOA will be followed by a gradual evolution, at a reasonable pace, of Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme, including its enrichment activities, to a commercial programme for exclusively peaceful purposes, consistent with international non-proliferation norms.

**** < > The E3/EU+3 envision that the implementation of this JCPOA will progressively allow them to gain confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s programme. The JCPOA reflects mutually determined parameters, consistent with practical needs, with agreed limits on the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment activities and R&D. The JCPOA addresses the E3/EU+3’s concerns, including through comprehensive measures providing for transparency and verification.

**** < > The JCPOA will produce the comprehensive lifting of all UN Security Council sanctions as well as multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear programme, including steps on access in areas of trade, technology, finance, and energy.

* I. Iran and E3/EU+3 will take the following voluntary measures within the timeframe asdetailed in this JCPOA and its Annexes

** < > NUCLEAR

*** A. ENRICHMENT, ENRICHMENT R&D, STOCKPILES

**** 1. Iran's long term plan includes certain agreed limitations on all uraniumenrichment and uranium enrichment-related activities including certainlimitations on specific research and development (R&D) activities for the first 8years, to be followed by gradual evolution, at a reasonable pace, to the nextstage of its enrichment activities for exclusively peaceful purposes, as describedin Annex I. Iran will abide by its voluntary commitments, as expressed in itsown long-term enrichment and enrichment R&D plan to be submitted as part ofthe initial declaration for the Additional Protocol to Iran’s SafeguardsAgreement.

**** 2. Iran will begin phasing out its IR-1 centrifuges in 10 years. During this period,Iran will keep its enrichment capacity at Natanz at up to a total installeduranium enrichment capacity of 5060 IR-1 centrifuges. Excess centrifuges andenrichment-related infrastructure at Natanz will be stored under IAEAcontinuous monitoring, as specified in Annex I.

**** 3. Iran will continue to conduct enrichment R&D in a manner that does notaccumulate enriched uranium. Iran's enrichment R&D with uranium for 10 yearswill only include IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges as laid out in Annex I, andIran will not engage in other isotope separation technologies for enrichment ofuranium as specified in Annex I. Iran will continue testing IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges, and will commence testing of up to 30 IR-6 and IR-8 centrifugesafter eight and a half years, as detailed in Annex I.

**** 4. As Iran will be phasing out its IR-1 centrifuges, it will not manufacture orassemble other centrifuges, except as provided for in Annex I, and will replacefailed centrifuges with centrifuges of the same type. Iran will manufactureadvanced centrifuge machines only for the purposes specified in this JCPOA.From the end of the eighth year, and as described in Annex I, Iran will start tomanufacture agreed numbers of IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuge machines withoutrotors and will store all of the manufactured machines at Natanz, under IAEAcontinuous monitoring until they are needed under Iran's long-term enrichmentand enrichment R&D plan.

**** 5. Based on its long-term plan, for 15 years, Iran will carry out its uraniumenrichment-related activities, including safeguarded R&D exclusively in theNatanz Enrichment facility, keep its level of uranium enrichment at up to 3.67%,and, at Fordow, refrain from any uranium enrichment and uranium enrichmentR&D and from keeping any nuclear material.

**** 6. Iran will convert the Fordow facility into a nuclear, physics and technologycentre. International collaboration including in the form of scientific jointpartnerships will be established in agreed areas of research. 1044 IR-1centrifuges in six cascades will remain in one wing at Fordow. Two of thesecascades will spin without uranium and will be transitioned, including throughappropriate infrastructure modification, for stable isotope production. The otherfour cascades with all associated infrastructure will remain idle. All othercentrifuges and enrichment-related infrastructure will be removed and storedunder IAEA continuous monitoring as specified in Annex I.

**** 7. During the 15 year period, and as Iran gradually moves to meet internationalqualification standards for nuclear fuel produced in Iran, it will keep its uraniumstockpile under 300 kg of up to 3.67% enriched uranium hexafluoride (UF6) orthe equivalent in other chemical forms. The excess quantities are to be soldbased on international prices and delivered to the international buyer in returnfor natural uranium delivered to Iran, or are to be down-blended to naturaluranium level. Enriched uranium in fabricated fuel assemblies from Russia orother sources for use in Iran's nuclear reactors will not be counted against theabove stated 300 kg UF6 stockpile, if the criteria set out in Annex I are met withregard to other sources. The Joint Commission will support assistance to Iran,including through IAEA technical cooperation as appropriate, in meetinginternational qualification standards for nuclear fuel produced in Iran. Allremaining uranium oxide enriched to between 5% and 20% will be fabricatedinto fuel for the Tehran Research Reactor (TRR). Any additional fuel needed forthe TRR will be made available to Iran at international market prices.

*** B. ARAK, HEAVY WATER, REPROCESSING

**** 8. Iran will redesign and rebuild a modernised heavy water research reactor inArak, based on an agreed conceptual design, using fuel enriched up to 3.67 %, ina form of an international partnership which will certify the final design. Thereactor will support peaceful nuclear research and radioisotope production formedical and industrial purposes. The redesigned and rebuilt Arak reactor willnot produce weapons grade plutonium. Except for the first core load, all of theactivities for redesigning and manufacturing of the fuel assemblies for theredesigned reactor will be carried out in Iran. All spent fuel from Arak will beshipped out of Iran for the lifetime of the reactor. This international partnershipwill include participating E3/EU+3 parties, Iran and such other countries as maybe mutually determined. Iran will take the leadership role as the owner and asthe project manager and the E3/EU+3 and Iran will, before Implementation Day, conclude an official document which would define the responsibilities assumedby the E3/EU+3 participants.

**** 9. Iran plans to keep pace with the trend of international technologicaladvancement in relying on light water for its future power and research reactorswith enhanced international cooperation, including assurance of supply ofnecessary fuel.

**** 10. There will be no additional heavy water reactors or accumulation of heavywater in Iran for 15 years. All excess heavy water will be made available forexport to the international market.

**** 11. Iran intends to ship out all spent fuel for all future and present power andresearch nuclear reactors, for further treatment or disposition as provided for inrelevant contracts to be duly concluded with the recipient party.

**** 12. For 15 years Iran will not, and does not intend to thereafter, engage in anyspent fuel reprocessing or construction of a facility capable of spent fuelreprocessing, or reprocessing R&D activities leading to a spent fuelreprocessing capability, with the sole exception of separation activities aimedexclusively at the production of medical and industrial radio-isotopes fromirradiated enriched uranium targets.

*** C. TRANSPARENCY AND CONFIDENCE BUILDING MEASURES

**** 13. Consistent with the respective roles of the President and Majlis (Parliament),Iran will provisionally apply the Additional Protocol to its ComprehensiveSafeguards Agreement in accordance with Article 17(b) of the AdditionalProtocol, proceed with its ratification within the timeframe as detailed in AnnexV and fully implement the modified Code 3.1 of the Subsidiary Arrangements toits Safeguards Agreement.

**** 14. Iran will fully implement the "Roadmap for Clarification of Past and PresentOutstanding Issues" agreed with the IAEA, containing arrangements to addresspast and present issues of concern relating to its nuclear programme as raisedin the annex to the IAEA report of 8 November 2011 (GOV/2011/65). Fullimplementation of activities undertaken under the Roadmap by Iran will becompleted by 15 October 2015, and subsequently the Director General willprovide by 15 December 2015 the final assessment on the resolution of all pastand present outstanding issues to the Board of Governors, and the E3+3, in theircapacity as members of the Board of Governors, will submit a resolution to theBoard of Governors for taking necessary action, with a view to closing the issue,without prejudice to the competence of the Board of Governors.

**** 15. Iran will allow the IAEA to monitor the implementation of the voluntarymeasures for their respective durations, as well as to implement transparencymeasures, as set out in this JCPOA and its Annexes. These measures include: along-term IAEA presence in Iran; IAEA monitoring of uranium ore concentrateproduced by Iran from all uranium ore concentrate plants for 25 years;containment and surveillance of centrifuge rotors and bellows for 20 years; useof IAEA approved and certified modern technologies including on-lineenrichment measurement and electronic seals; and a reliable mechanism toensure speedy resolution of IAEA access concerns for 15 years, as defined inAnnex I.

**** 16. Iran will not engage in activities, including at the R&D level, that couldcontribute to the development of a nuclear explosive device, including uraniumor plutonium metallurgy activities, as specified in Annex I.

*** V. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

**** 34. Iran and the E3/EU+3 will implement their JCPOA commitments according tothe sequence specified in Annex V. The milestones for implementation are as follows:

***** i. Finalisation Day is the date on which negotiations of this JCPOA are concludedamong the E3/EU+3 and Iran, to be followed promptly by submission of theresolution endorsing this JCPOA to the UN Security Council for adoption withoutdelay.

***** ii. Adoption Day is the date 90 days after the endorsement of this JCPOA by the UNSecurity Council, or such earlier date as may be determined by mutual consentof the JCPOA participants, at which time this JCPOA and the commitments in thisJCPOA come into effect. Beginning on that date, JCPOA participants will makenecessary arrangements and preparations for the implementation of their JCPOAcommitments.

***** ii. Implementation Day is the date on which, simultaneously with the IAEA reportverifying implementation by Iran of the nuclear-related measures described inSections 15.1. to 15.11 of Annex V, the EU and the United States take theactions described in Sections 16 and 17 of Annex V respectively and inaccordance with the UN Security Council resolution, the actions described inSection 18 of Annex V occur at the UN level.

***** iv. Transition Day is the date 8 years after Adoption Day or the date on which theDirector General of the IAEA submits a report stating that the IAEA has reachedthe Broader Conclusion that all nuclear material in Iran remains in peacefulactivities, whichever is earlier. On that date, the EU and the United States willtake the actions described in Sections 20 and 21 of Annex V respectively and Iran will seek, consistent with the Constitutional roles of the President andParliament, ratification of the Additional Protocol.

***** v. UN Security Council resolution Termination Day is the date on which the UNSecurity Council resolution endorsing this JCPOA terminates according to itsterms, which is to be 10 years from Adoption Day, provided that the provisionsof previous resolutions have not been reinstated. On that date, the EU will takethe actions described in Section 25 of Annex V.

**** 35. The sequence and milestones set forth above and in Annex V are withoutprejudice to the duration of JCPOA commitments stated in this JCPOA.

*** < > DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM

**** 36. If Iran believed that any or all of the E3/EU+3 were not meeting theircommitments under this JCPOA, Iran could refer the issue to the JointCommission for resolution; similarly, if any of the E3/EU+3 believed that Iranwas not meeting its commitments under this JCPOA, any of the E3/EU+3 coulddo the same. The Joint Commission would have 15 days to resolve the issue,unless the time period was extended by consensus. After Joint Commissionconsideration, any participant could refer the issue to Ministers of ForeignAffairs, if it believed the compliance issue had not been resolved. Ministerswould have 15 days to resolve the issue, unless the time period was extendedby consensus. After Joint Commission consideration – in parallel with (or in lieuof) review at the Ministerial level - either the complaining participant or theparticipant whose performance is in question could request that the issue beconsidered by an Advisory Board, which would consist of three members (oneeach appointed by the participants in the dispute and a third independent member). The Advisory Board should provide a non-binding opinion on thecompliance issue within 15 days. If, after this 30-day process the issue is notresolved, the Joint Commission would consider the opinion of the AdvisoryBoard for no more than 5 days in order to resolve the issue. If the issue still hasnot been resolved to the satisfaction of the complaining participant, and if thecomplaining participant deems the issue to constitute significant nonperformance, then that participant could treat the unresolved issue as groundsto cease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in partand/or notify the UN Security Council that it believes the issue constitutessignificant non-performance.

**** 37. Upon receipt of the notification from the complaining participant, as describedabove, including a description of the good-faith efforts the participant made toexhaust the dispute resolution process specified in this JCPOA, the UN SecurityCouncil, in accordance with its procedures, shall vote on a resolution tocontinue the sanctions lifting. If the resolution described above has not beenadopted within 30 days of the notification, then the provisions of the old UNSecurity Council resolutions would be re-imposed, unless the UN SecurityCouncil decides otherwise. In such event, these provisions would not apply withretroactive effect to contracts signed between any party and Iran or Iranianindividuals and entities prior to the date of application, provided that theactivities contemplated under and execution of such contracts are consistentwith this JCPOA and the previous and current UN Security Council resolutions.The UN Security Council, expressing its intention to prevent the reapplication ofthe provisions if the issue giving rise to the notification is resolved within thisperiod, intends to take into account the views of the States involved in the issueand any opinion on the issue of the Advisory Board. Iran has stated that ifsanctions are reinstated in whole or in part, Iran will treat that as grounds tocease performing its commitments under this JCPOA in whole or in part.

**  Annex I – Nuclear-related measures

*** A. GENERAL

**** 1. The sequence of implementation of the commitments detailed in this Annex is specifiedin Annex V to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Unless otherwisespecified, the durations of the commitments in this Annex are from Implementation Day.

*** B. ARAK HEAVY WATER RESEARCH REACTOR

**** 2. Iran will modernise the Arak heavy water research reactor to support peaceful nuclearresearch and radioisotopes production for medical and industrial purposes. Iran willredesign and rebuild the reactor, based on the agreed conceptual design (as attachedto this Annex) to support its peaceful nuclear research and production needs andpurposes, including testing of fuel pins and assembly prototypes and structuralmaterials. The design will be such as to minimise the production of plutonium and not toproduce weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation. The power of the redesignedreactor will not exceed 20 MWth. The E3/EU+3 and Iran share the understanding thatthe parameters in the conceptual design are subject to possible and necessaryadjustments in developing the final design while fully preserving the above-mentionedpurposes and principles of modernisation.

**** 3. Iran will not pursue construction at the existing unfinished reactor based on its originaldesign and will remove the existing calandria and retain it in Iran. The calandria will bemade inoperable by filling any openings in the calandria with concrete such that theIAEA can verify that it will not be usable for a future nuclear application. In redesigningand reconstructing of the modernized Arak heavy water research reactor, Iran will maximise the use of existing infrastructure already installed at the current Arak researchreactor.

**** 4. Iran will take the leadership role as the owner and as the project manager, and haveresponsibility for overall implementation of the Arak modernisation project, withE3/EU+3 participants assuming responsibilities regarding the modernisation of the Arakreactor as described in this Annex. A Working Group composed of E3/EU+3participants will be established to facilitate the redesigning and rebuilding of thereactor. An international partnership composed of Iran and the Working Group wouldimplement the Arak modernisation project. The Working Group could be enlarged toinclude other countries by consensus of the participants of the Working Group andIran. E3/EU+3 participants and Iran will conclude an official document expressing theirstrong commitments to the Arak modernisation project in advance of ImplementationDay which would provide an assured path forward to modernise the reactor and woulddefine the responsibilities assumed by the E3/EU+3 participants, and subsequentlycontracts would be concluded. The participants of the Working Group will provideassistance needed by Iran for redesigning and rebuilding the reactor, consistent withtheir respective national laws, in such a manner as to enable the safe and timelyconstruction and commissioning of the modernised reactor.

**** 31. For 15 years, Iran will install gas centrifuge machines, or enrichment-relatedinfrastructure, whether suitable for uranium enrichment, research and development, or stable isotope enrichment, exclusively at the locations and for the activities specifiedunder this JCPOA.

*** G. CENTRIFUGES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

**** 32. Iran will continue to conduct enrichment R&D in a manner that does not accumulateenriched uranium. For 10 years and consistent with its enrichment R&D plan, Iran'senrichment R&D with uranium will only include IR-4, IR-5, IR-6 and IR-8 centrifuges.Mechanical testing on up to two single centrifuges for each type will be carried out onlyon the IR-2m, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, IR-6s, IR-7 and IR-8. Iran will build or test, with orwithout uranium, only those gas centrifuges specified in this JCPOA.

**** 33. Consistent with its plan, Iran will continue working with the 164-machine IR-2m cascadeat PFEP in order to complete the necessary tests until 30 November 2015 or the day ofimplementation of this JCPOA, whichever comes later, and after that it will take thesemachines out of the PFEP and store them under IAEA continuous monitoring at Natanzin Hall B of FEP.

**** 34. Consistent with its plan, Iran will continue working with the 164-machine IR-4 cascadeat PFEP in order to complete the necessary tests until 30 November 2015 or the day ofimplementation of this JCPOA, whichever comes later, and after that it will take thesemachines out of the PFEP and store them under IAEA continuous monitoring at Natanzin Hall B of FEP.

**** 38. Iran will commence, upon start of implementation of the JCPOA, testing of the IR-8 onsingle centrifuge machines and its intermediate cascades and will commence thetesting of up to 30 centrifuges machines from one and a half years before the end ofyear 10. Iran will proceed from single centrifuges to small cascades to intermediatecascades in a logical sequence.

**** 39. For 10 years, Iran, consistent with the established practice, will recombine the enrichedand depleted streams from the IR-6 and IR-8 cascades through the use of weldedpipework on withdrawal main headers in a manner that precludes the withdrawal ofenriched and depleted uranium materials and verified by the IAEA.

**** 40. For 15 years, Iran will conduct all testing of centrifuges with uranium only at the PFEP.Iran will conduct all mechanical testing of centrifuges only at the PFEP and the TehranResearch Centre.

Iran will limit its stable isotope production activities with gas centrifuges to the FFEP for15 years and will use no more than 348 IR-1 centrifuges for these activities at the FFEP.The associated R&D activities in Iran will occur at the FFEP and at Iran's declared andmonitored centrifuge manufacturing facilities for testing, modification and balancingthese IR-1 centrifuges.

**** 51. The IAEA will establish a baseline for the amount of uranium legacy from pastenrichment operations that will remain in Fordow. Iran will permit the IAEA regularaccess, including daily as requested by the IAEA, access to the FFEP in order tomonitor Iran's production of stable isotopes and the absence of undeclared nuclearmaterial and activities at the FFEP for 15 years.

*** I. OTHER ASPECTS OF ENRICHMENT

**** 52. Iran will abide by its voluntary commitments as expressed in its own long termenrichment and enrichment R&D plan to be submitted as part of the initial declarationdescribed in Article 2 of the Additional Protocol.[1] The IAEA will confirm on an annualbasis, for the duration of the plan that the nature and scope and scale of Iran'senrichment and enrichment R&D activities are in line with this plan.

**** 53. Iran will start to install necessary infrastructure for the IR-8 at Natanz in Hall B of FEPafter year 10.

**** 54. An agreed template for describing different centrifuge types (IR-1, IR-2m, IR-4, IR-5, IR6, IR-6s, IR-7, IR-8) and the associated definitions need to be accomplished byimplementation day.

**** 55. An agreed procedure for measuring IR-1, IR-2m and IR-4 centrifuge performance dataneeds to be accomplished by implementation day.

*** J. URANIUM STOCKS AND FUELS

**** 56. Iran will maintain a total enriched uranium stockpile of no more than 300 kg of up to 3.67% enriched uranium hexafluoride (or the equivalent in different chemical forms) for 15 years.

**** 57. All enriched uranium hexafluoride in excess of 300 kg of up to 3.67% enriched UF6 (orthe equivalent in different chemical forms) will be down blended to natural uranium levelor be sold on the international market and delivered to the international buyer in returnfor natural uranium delivered to Iran. Iran will enter into a commercial contract with anentity outside Iran for the purchase and transfer of its enriched uranium stockpile inexcess of 300 kg UF6 in return for natural uranium delivered to Iran. The E3/EU+3 willfacilitate, where applicable, the conclusion and implementation of this contract. Iranmay choose to seek to sell excess enriched uranium to the IAEA fuel bank inKazakhstan when the fuel bank becomes operational.

**** 58. All uranium oxide enriched to between 5% and 20% will be fabricated into fuel platesfor the Tehran Research Reactor or transferred, based on a commercial transaction,outside of Iran or diluted to an enrichment level of 3.67% or less. Scrap oxide and otherforms not in plates that cannot be fabricated into TRR fuel plates will be transferred,based on a commercial transaction, outside of Iran or diluted to an enrichment level of3.67% or less. In case of future supply of 19.75% enriched uranium oxide (U3O8) forTRR fuel plates fabrication, all scrap oxide and other forms not in plates that cannot befabricated into TRR fuel plates, containing uranium enriched to between 5% and 20%,will be transferred, based on a commercial transaction, outside of Iran or diluted to anenrichment level of 3.67% or less within 6 months of its production. Scrap plates will betransferred, based on a commercial transaction, outside Iran. The commercialtransactions should be structured to return an equivalent amount of natural uranium toIran. For 15 years, Iran will not build or operate facilities for converting fuel plates orscrap back to UF6.

**** 59. Russian designed, fabricated and licensed fuel assemblies for use in Russian-suppliedreactors in Iran do not count against the 300 kg UF6 stockpile limit. Enriched uranium infabricated fuel assemblies from other sources outside of Iran for use in Iran's nuclearresearch and power reactors, including those which will be fabricated outside of Iran forthe initial fuel load of the modernised Arak research reactor, which are certified by the fuel supplier and the appropriate Iranian authority to meet international standards, willnot count against the 300 kg UF6 stockpile limit. The Joint Commission will establish aTechnical Working Group with the goal of enabling fuel to be fabricated in Iran whileadhering to the agreed stockpile parameters (300 kg of up to 3.67 % enriched UF6 orthe equivalent in different chemical forms). This Technical Working Group will also,within one year, work to develop objective technical criteria for assessing whetherfabricated fuel and its intermediate products can be readily converted to UF6. Enricheduranium in fabricated fuel assemblies and its intermediate products manufactured inIran and certified to meet international standards, including those for the modernisedArak research reactor, will not count against the 300 kg UF6 stockpile limit provided theTechnical Working Group of the Joint Commission approves that such fuel assembliesand their intermediate products cannot be readily reconverted into UF6. This could forinstance be achieved through impurities (e.g. burnable poisons or otherwise) containedin fuels or through the fuel being in a chemical form such that direct conversion back toUF6 would be technically difficult without dissolution and purification. The objectivetechnical criteria will guide the approval process of the Technical Working Group. TheIAEA will monitor the fuel fabrication process for any fuel produced in Iran to verify thatthe fuel and intermediate products comport with the fuel fabrication process that wasapproved by the Technical Working Group. The Joint Commission will also supportassistance to Iran including through IAEA technical cooperation as appropriate, inmeeting international qualification standards for nuclear fuel produced by Iran.

**** 60. Iran will seek to enter into a commercial contract with entities outside Iran for thepurchase of fuel for the TRR and enriched uranium targets. The E3/EU+3 will facilitate,as needed, the conclusion and implementation of this contract. In the case of lack ofconclusion of a contract with a fuel supplier, E3/EU+3 will supply a quantity of 19.75%enriched uranium oxide (U3O8) and deliver to Iran, exclusively for the purpose offabrication in Iran of fuel for the TRR and enriched uranium targets for the lifetime of thereactor. This 19.75% enriched uranium oxide (U3O8) will be supplied in increments nogreater than approximately 5 kg and each new increment will be provided only when theprevious increment of this material has been verified by the IAEA to have been mixed with aluminum to make fuel for the TRR or fabricated into enriched uranium targets. Iranwill notify the E3/EU+3 within 2 year before the contingency of TRR fuel will beexhausted in order to have the uranium oxide available 6 months before the end of the 2year period.

*** K. CENTRIFUGE MANUFACTURING

**** 61. Consistent with its enrichment and enrichment R&D plan, Iran will only engage inproduction of centrifuges, including centrifuge rotors suitable for isotope separation orany other centrifuge components, to meet the enrichment and enrichment R&Drequirements of this Annex.

Consistent with its plan, Iran will use the stock of IR-1 centrifuge machines in storage,which are in excess of the remaining 5060 IR-1 centrifuges in Natanz and the IR-1centrifuges installed at Fordow, for the replacement of failed or damaged machines.Whenever during the 10 year period from the start of the implementation of the JCPOA,the level of stock of IR-1 machines falls to 500 or below, Iran may maintain this level ofstock by resuming production of IR-1 machines at a rate up to the average monthlycrash rate without exceeding the stock of 500.

**** 63. Consistent with its plan, at the end of year 8, Iran will commence manufacturing of IR-6and IR-8 centrifuges without rotors through year 10 at a rate of up to 200 centrifugesper year for each type. After year 10, Iran will produce complete centrifuges with thesame rate to meet its enrichment and enrichment R&D needs. Iran will store them atNatanz in an above ground location, under IAEA continuous monitoring, until they areneeded for final assembly according to the enrichment and enrichment R&D plan.

*** L. ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL AND MODIFIED CODE 3.1

**** 64. Iran will notify the IAEA of provisional application of the Additional Protocol to itsSafeguards Agreement in accordance with Article 17(b) of the Additional Protocolpending its entry into force, and subsequently seek ratification and entry into force,consistent with the respective roles of the President and the Majlis (Parliament).

**** 65. Iran will notify the IAEA that it will fully implement the Modified Code 3.1 of theSubsidiary Arrangement to Iran’s Safeguards Agreement as long as the SafeguardsAgreement remains in force.

***** iii. Iran will increase the number of designated IAEA inspectors to the range of 130-150within 9 months from the date of the implementation of the JCPOA, and will generally allow the designation of inspectors from nations that have diplomatic relations with Iran,consistent with its laws and regulations.

*** O. TRANSPARENCY RELATED TO URANIUM ORE CONCENTRATE (UOC)

**** 68. Iran will permit the IAEA to monitor, through agreed measures that will includecontainment and surveillance measures, for 25 years, that all uranium ore concentrateproduced in Iran or obtained from any other source, is transferred to the uraniumconversion facility (UCF) in Esfahan or to any other future uranium conversion facilitywhich Iran might decide to build in Iran within this period.

**** 69. Iran will provide the IAEA with all necessary information such that the IAEA will be ableto verify the production of the uranium ore concentrate and the inventory of uranium oreconcentrate produced in Iran or obtained from any other source for 25 years.

*** Q. ACCESS

**** 74. Requests for access pursuant to provisions of this JCPOA will be made in good faith,with due observance of the sovereign rights of Iran, and kept to the minimum necessaryto effectively implement the verification responsibilities under this JCPOA. In line withnormal international safeguards practice, such requests will not be aimed at interferingwith Iranian military or other national security activities, but will be exclusively forresolving concerns regarding fulfilment of the JCPOA commitments and Iran's othernon-proliferation and safeguards obligations. The following procedures are for thepurpose of JCPOA implementation between the E3/EU+3 and Iran and are withoutprejudice to the safeguards agreement and the Additional Protocol thereto. Inimplementing this procedure as well as other transparency measures, the IAEA will berequested to take every precaution to protect commercial, technological and industrialsecrets as well as other confidential information coming to its knowledge.

*** < > Attachment: Arak conceptual design

** < > Fundamental Principles:

**** i. Maximize use of the current infrastructure of original design of Arak research reactor,designated by the IAEA as IR-40, according to their respective ratings.

**** ii. Modernizing of the original design in order to be a multi-purpose research reactorcomprising radio-isotope production, structural materials and fuel (pins and assemblyprototypes) testing and able to conduct other neutronic experiments which demandhigh neutron fluxes (more than 1014).

**** iii. Using heavy water as coolant, moderator and reflector. Light water would be utilized asan annular ring around the compact new core for safety reasons if necessary.

**** iv. Around 78 fuel assemblies in a tight hexagonal grid spacing with the followingpreliminary characteristics will be loaded.

**** v. Up to 3.67 percent enriched UO2, in the improved assembly design, will be used as fuel.

**** vi. Power will not exceed to 20 MWth.

**** vii. Adding different types of beam tubes to the existing beam tubes which being extendedto the edge of the new compact core.

**** viii. Having one central channel in the center of the new core with passive cooling systemfor the purpose of structural materials and fuel pins and assembly prototypes testingwith neutron flux beyond 2•1014, twelve in-core irradiation channels (IIC) inside the coreand twelve lateral irradiation chennals (LIC) just next to the outer ring of fuel assemblies.

**** ix. The location of the in-core and lateral irradiation channels should be designed and fixedto meet the best anticipated performances.

**** x. Consistent with relevant section of Annex 1, sibsidiary laboratories are part of themodernization project of the Arak Research Reactor. In Addition, Annex III reinforcedesign and construction of subsidiary laboratoties.

**** xi. The highest tolerable pressure for the first and second loop is 0.33 Mpa (at theinterance of the reactor pit).

**** xii. The highest possible flow rate for coolant is 610 kg/s at the pressure of 0.33 MPa in themain piping system and 42 Kg/sec for Moderator with the same conditions.
